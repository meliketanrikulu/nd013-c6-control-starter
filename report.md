### Solution
A PID controller is implemented and integrated into the provided framework for throttle and steering control. Several fixes are added to the framework and simulation client to make the control smoother and more stable. PID controller (proportional–integral–derivative controller) parameters are handled separately for steering and throttle. Errors are also calculated separately. I tuned the parameters for the PID by observing the responses.

Due to insufficient hardware for simulation, an application was developed on the remote desktop provided by UDACITY. The results are given below. </br>
